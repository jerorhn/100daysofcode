# 100 Days of Code

### The Goal
Over the next 100 days, starting on the 1st of January, 2021, I will be making an effort to code every single day. What I code doesn't matter, but I have some simple project ideas in mind. I am not setting a minimum or maximum time that I should be coding each day as I think this will discourage me from getting all the way through if I have a busy day and might only get 15 min to code. So, any coding counts. 

### The Project Ideas
1. Calculator
2. To Do List
3. Chess
4. Portfolio
5. Cooking Conversion
6. Rock, Paper, Scissors
7. Weather App
8. Quiz Game
9. Habit Tracker
10. Choose Your Own Adventure
11. SMS Downtime Alerter
12. Expense Tracker
13. Chatbot (do I have that book?)
14. Goodreads Replica (book tracker)
15. Pixel Art Generator
16. Daily Desktop Background (Unsplash API, use mantra on top of image?)
17. Alexa Skill
18. Hangman
19. Pomodoro
20. Automation (automate something)

All of these projects are simply ideas and may not all be completed, either because I run out of time, or because I find other things I want to create. Their entire purpose is to make sure I don't get stuck not knowing what to code. As I complete projects I will cross them off. If I start to run out of uncompleted projects, I will come up with some more ideas and add them to this list. 

### Plan of Execution
**Day 1** - Choose a project, Create User Stories, Watch any Tutorials I might want (while taking notes, but NOT coding along), Complete Project Planning Worksheet, Do any other necessary research

**Day 2** - Setup project structure, Setup git, Complete any final research or leftover tasks from day one

\*If all done with day 2 and still have time, can move on to day 3

**Day 3** - Code HTML and CSS

**Day 4** - Code JS or any backend needs

**Day 5** - Finishing touches and Post to portfolio (if completed)

This is a basic plan to work through projects in a timely manner. However, longer projects, or a busy week, might mean that a project takes more than 5 days (or less) and can expand to take as many days as needed. 

### Gimme Days
Do to medical reasons, I may not be able to code on a certain day. If not, the goal will be to watch a tutorial, listen to a podcast, or read an article or part of a book relating to coding. However, if I cannot do one of these, it will not break my streak.

Another reason I might need a break is if it is a really busy week with a lot going on. The world is still very unpredictable right now. If I need a day, just because, I can take one but must watch a tutorial, podcast, or article. I am allowing myself one of these days per short project (5 days) and two per long project (10 days). However, the hope for these days is that what I research is related to another project. For instance, maybe I need a break day from building the Chess Game, so I decide to do my Day 1 research for the Pomodoro project. 

### Tracking
Every Day, I will make a coorelated post to the wiki. In it I will include what I did that day, and also what my goals are for the next day. I'm hoping that as I work through this challenge, that I will become more accurate at prodicting the amount of work that I can complete on a given day. Also, like mentioned, I will be updating this page to mark off completed projects. Once I decide to make the portfolio, it will be connected to this project. All other projects will be completed in their own repo.
